# AlongTrack Simulator
A MATLAB  ground track simulator for satellite altimetry missions

This tool is designed to sample numerical data using the same sampling patterns of real satellite altimetry missions. We have use the simulator applied to both stochastic models and fluid simulation with the [WaveVortexModel](https://wavevortexmodel.org).

See the [documentation website](https://satmapkit.github.io/AlongTrackSimulator/) for complete information on installation and usage.

## Installation

You may install this as part of [OceanKit](https://github.com/JeffreyEarly/OceanKit), or directly from here using the command-line,
```
https://github.com/satmapkit/AlongTrackSimulator
```
to clone the repo, and then installing package from within MATLAB
```matlab
mpminstall("local/path/to/AlongTrackSimulator", Authoring=true); 
```
with authoring enabled.
