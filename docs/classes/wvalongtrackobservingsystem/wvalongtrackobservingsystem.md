#  WVAlongTrackObservingSystem

create a new along track observing system


---

## Declaration
```matlab
 self = WVAlongTrackObservingSystem(model,alongTrackGroup)
```
## Parameters
+ `model`  the WVModel instance
+ `alongTrackGroup`  name of the observing system

## Returns
+ `self`  a new instance of WVAlongTrackObservingSystem

## Discussion

  This class is initialized when a
  `WVModelOutputGroupAlongTrack` is initialized, and thus does
  not need to be initialized directly.
